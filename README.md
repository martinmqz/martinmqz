## Hi there! 👋  
I'm Martin — a frontend architect and full-stack engineer focused on scalable UI systems, modular content platforms, and developer enablement.

I build tools that streamline workflows, clarify onboarding, and surface architectural nuance. My work often blends React, TypeScript, JavaScript (ES6+), Next.js, accessibility, and DevOps automation to create systems that are intuitive, performant, and reusable.

If you're into clean architecture, copy/paste-ready components, or subtle distinctions in frontend logic—feel free to explore, fork, or [reach out](mailto:martin@webect.com). Always happy to chat architecture, onboarding clarity, or frontend nuance. You can also connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/webect/).

### 🔍 Latest Personal Projects  
These are experiments, prototypes, and ideas I’ve built outside of work—often to explore architectural patterns, test onboarding flows, or just scratch a technical itch. Some are polished, some are playful, all reflect my curiosity and love for developer tooling.
