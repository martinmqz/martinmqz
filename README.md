## Hi there! üëã

I'm Martin ‚Äî a frontend architect and full-stack engineer focused on scalable UI systems, modular content platforms, and developer enablement.

### üõ† What I Build
Here you'll find tools, prototypes, and utilities that streamline development workflows, clarify onboarding, and surface architectural nuance. I focus on scalable UI systems, modular content platforms, and rapid prototyping‚Äîoften blending React, TypeScript, accessibility, and DevOps automation.

If you're into clean architecture, copy/paste-ready components, or subtle distinctions in frontend logic‚Äîfeel free to explore, fork, or reach out. I'm always up for a thoughtful technical conversation.
